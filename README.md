open-hydro-dp-b
===============

A library using discrete dynamic programming to help determine efficient operating settings for individual hydropower turbines. The model works better for lower head, seperate-intake configurations. It supports generator efficiency curves (%eff vs output at reference head) and turbine curves (%eff vs output at reference head with adjustments). This is the advanced branch of open-hydro-dp.
